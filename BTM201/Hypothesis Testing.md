- If the manager wants to show that the new method is better than the old method, then we how that $\mu > 0$.
- The alternative hypothesis is what the test is attempting to establish
- The null hypothesis, denoted by $H_{0}$ is a tentative assumption about a population parameter (the opposite of what is stated in the alternative hypothesis.)
- The research hypothesis should be expressed as the alternative hypothesis.
- The conclusion that the research hypothesis is true comes from sample data that contradict the null hypothesis.

# Our argument

Alternative Hypothesis $\mu > 0$
Null Hypothesis $\mu \leq 0$

We have to support *Alternative Hypothesis*

## How to support argument?
does p-value need to be smaller? bigger? -> smaller
- There is a critical criteria -> usually 0.1 0.05 0.01 criteria
does [[Standardized Normal Distribution|z-value]] need to be smaller? bigger -> bigger
