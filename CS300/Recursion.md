Recurrence relation

# Unrolling
### Selection sort
Find the smallest, recursively sort the remainder.
$$
T(n) = \Theta(n) + T(n-1)
$$
$$
T(n)  = \Theta(n^2)
$$
# Substitution method
Guess the form of the solution, use mathematical induction to find the constants and show that the solution works.
*Note* We have to prove $O$ and $\Omega$ eparately.
