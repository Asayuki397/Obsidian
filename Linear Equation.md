# Definition
A linear equation in n-variables $x_{1},\dots,x_{n}$
is something in the form $$
a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} +\dots + a_{n}x_{n} = b
$$
where $$
a_{1}, \dots a_{n}, b = const 
$$
and not all $a_{i}$ 's are zero


## Nonlinear equation examples

## Homogeneous linear equation
A Linear equation $a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2} +\dots + a_{n}x_{n} = b$ is called homogeneous if $b = 0$
