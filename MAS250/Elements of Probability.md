# Definition

### Sample space
[[Collection]] of all possible outcomes of experiment any subset of sample space is *event*.
- ex ) toss a coin -> Sample space : $\{H, T\}$  Event : $\emptyset, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H,T\}$
- Toss a coin 3 times -> Sample space : {HHH, HHT, ..., TTT} Events  : {HTT, THT, TTH}

Let events as $E, F$

- *Intersect* $E\cap F$ event that $E$ and $F$ happens
- *Union* $E\cup F$ event that $E$ or $F$ happens
- *Complement* $E^C$ event $E$ doesn't happens

# Properties
1. Commutative Law$$
E\cup F = F\cup E, E\cap F = F\cap E
$$
2. Associative Law$$
(E\cup F)\cup G = E \cup (F \cup G)
$$
associative also hold for $\cap$

3. Distributive Law $$
(E\cup F)\cap G = (E\cap G)\cup(F\cap G)
$$
4. De Morgan's Law $$
(E\cup F)^C = E^C\cap F^C
$$
