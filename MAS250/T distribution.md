# Definition

$z$ follows [[Standard Normal Distribution]]
$W$ follows [[Chi-square with n degrees of freedom]]

and two are independent

$$
\frac{z}{\sqrt{ \frac{w}{n} }}
$$
is called $t_{n}$ ; t-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom

# Facts
[[Expected Value | mean]] : 0
[[Variance]] : $\frac{n}{n-2} ( n>2)$ (it diverges when $n \leq 2$)

- If n is very large, $\frac{\chi_{n}^2}{n} \approx \mathbb{E}z_{1}^2$ = 1
- If n is very large
$$
t_{n} \approx Z
$$
It approximates [[Standard Normal Distribution]]
It is called *Law of large numbers* #important
