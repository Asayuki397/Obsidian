- Peak at [[Sample mean]]
- Decrease on both sides in a **symmetric way**, otherwise -> skewed data, skewed to left(or right)

Notation
$\bar{X}$ : sample mean
$S$ : sample standard deviation

$\Rightarrow$ Approximately 68% of datas $\in (\bar{X} - S,\space \bar{X} + S)$
$\Rightarrow$ Approximately 95% of datas $\in (\bar{X} - 2S,\space \bar{X} + 2S)$
