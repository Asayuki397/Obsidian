# Representable Numbers

## Limitation 1
- Can only exactly represent numbers of the form $\frac{x}{2^k}$
  - Other rational numbers have repeating bit representations

 - Values $$
\frac{1}{3} = 0.010101[01]\dots_{2}
$$
$$
\frac{1}{5} = 0.001100110011[0011]\dots_{2}
$$
$$
\frac{1}{10} = 0.0001100110011[0011]\dots_{2}
$$

## Limitation 2
- Just one setting of binary point within the $w$ bits
  - Limited range of numbers
